## Welcome to the PoliticalWatchParty.com Support

If you find a bug or want to request a feature for the site, this is the place to do it.  Please bare in mind that this is 
part-time volunteer effort, so I'll deal with things as time permits.  

To view or submit a bug, please see the [Issues](https://github.com/sterno/PWP-Support/issues) page.

### For the nerds in the audience

PoliticalWatchParty.com is built using React on an AWS Lambda back-end.  I'll be open sourcing the code at some point in the future, but after the rush to get this out the door, it's in need of some TLC.  I'd certainly love some helpe supporting this in the long run.
